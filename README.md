# :books: Online Library Management System
The Library Management System is a software built to handle the primary housekeeping functions of a library which help libraries keep track of their books, members' feedback and profiles. It also maintains a database for entering new books and recording books that have been borrowed with their respective due dates.

## Motivation
This is a step taken for borrowers to view the books available in the library online especially in scenarios where they cannot have direct access to the library due to Covid like situations. Thus this management system helps people  with an user account to get access to all the library stock information and borrow their books online.
